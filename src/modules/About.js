              Design, both in terms of asthetics and UX, is so essential. You might have the most powerful application in your field, but unless it is intuitive and beautful, you are in for an uphill battle.

            <p>
              Ensuring applications have the right features is something I care a lot about. That often means saying no to users wanting additions and choosing to include only features that add true value to the application.

            <h2><FontAwesome name='user'/>User</h2>
            <p>
              For me, it is all about the users. Understand how a user thinks, acts and interacts is essential to building a great application. In everything I build, I try to best understand my user and what will work best for them.

              Technology is my life. I love building PCâ€™s, following tech trends and coding my day away. After studying marketing, I worked at Unilever on household brands such as Streets, Continental and Dove. In marketing a few things always had my focus; design, consumer behaviour and tech. I was the go-to person for analytics, the interim IT person and always had a keen eye for design.

              I am now a web developer and use all the knowledge I gained while a marketer in my work. I love building applications that have clean, intuitive designs that focus on user experience. I am now looking to join a team where I can share my love for coding, where I can build great apps, learn and develop my skills and have fun!
